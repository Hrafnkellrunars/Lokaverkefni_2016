# Contributing to steam-tradeoffers

__This is not a helpdesk__.

__Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/node-steam-tradeoffers/wiki/FAQ)__ first if you have any questions.

If your question is not answered here, please ask it in [https://github.com/steam-forward/node-steam-forum](https://github.com/steam-forward/node-steam-forum), __please do not open an issue here__. Issues are only for bugs and feature requests. All question issues here will be closed and locked on the spot.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports without a minimal test case are rejected. If your bot just returns an error and doesn't crash, the library most likely works correctly. Please double check your own code for issues. Note that __Steam itself__ does most of the checks which generate such errors, not the library.

## Pull Requests

Please follow the existing code formatting, do not change any interfaces without need, use common sense when adding features so they won't break the existing functionality, test your code prior to submission and update README accordingly.

__Always__ do only one pull request per bug/feature.

I reserve the right to close any pull request and/or rewrite your feature or fix myself. Please note that reviewing and testing your code also takes time so your changes won't be merged immediately after submission.

-Thank you.
